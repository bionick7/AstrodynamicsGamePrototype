ship: >
  A ship represents any artificial construction in space that the party has influence over.
  These can be transport ships, mining vessels, military ships or even space stations. Ships consist of a 
  [[ship_class]] that set the basic stats, like payload capacity and can be customized with [[module]]s
  to customize it for a certain role. In addition to their modules any ship can carry as much of any resource
  as the [[transfer]] allows.
planet: >
  A planet refers to any natural satellite at which ships can park. A planet may be a source of
  [[resource]] and can contain [[resource]] and [[module]].

ship_class: >
  A ship class determines the base [[stat]] for a ship as well as the maximum cargo capacity,
  [[Δv]] and [[specific_impulse]]. Ship classes can be build in a [[shipyard]] if it is fitted appropriatly* 
  (cf [[shipyard]]) and then fitted with modules afterwards.
module: >
  A ship module is an entity that can be fitted to a ship. To fit a module onto a ship is instant for the
  purpose of this simulation. The modules can be anything from production facilities to military equipment to 
  [[shipyard]] parts. Some, like [[shpmod_heatshield]] or [[shpmod_droptank]] provide a special benefit, 
  while others provide an increase to certain stats. Most modules have a [[weight]] associated with them,
  so certain [[transfer]] are limited in the types of modules they can bring.
  Modules can be build in a [[shipyard]] if it is fitted appropriatly* (cf [[shipyard]]).

stat: >
  A stat (short for statistical measurement of abiliat<) is a measure of capability of a [[ship]] to do a
  certain task. The stats modeled in this simulation are [[health]], [[attack]] and [[defense]] for [[ordonance]]
  [[kinetic]] and [[boarding]] attacks, [[initiative]] and [[power]]
Δv: A measure of capability of the ship to perform certain [[transfer]]. Decrases with increasing payload.
specific_impulse: A measure of engine efficiency. Determines how much [[Δv]] decreases with increasing payload.
weight: >
  The prime measurement of quantity of a [[resource]] or size of a [[module]]. Weight is measured in 'counts',
  where 1 count corresponds to roughly 10 metric tonns. The count is often omitted in user interface.
  Physically knowladgable readers should know that weight is simply used as an alias for mass in the cosmonautics
  jargon. A tradition that is carried over from shipping and aviation.

ordonance: >
  A type of attack that represents attacks by mostly missile/torpedos that deal dammage by their
  carried ordonancy. These can be chemical explosives or tactical nuclear weapons. Ordonance weapons 
  thend to be slow-moving, but powerfull. Ordonance defense can be provided by armor
   or point-defense systems.
kinetic: >
  A type of attack that represents attacks by hyper-velocity cannons, like rail- or coilguns.
  Kinetic weapons tend to provide quick, hard to avoid dammage and get more powerfull the higher the relative
  velocities of the ships. Kinetic defense can only be provided by special armor.
boarding: TBD

health:  A family of [[stat]] measuring the ammount of damage that the ship can take. Split up by attack type.
attack:  A family of [[stat]] measuring the ammount of damage that the ship can deal. Split up by attack type.
defense: A family of [[stat]] measuring the ammount of damage that the ship can negate. Split up by attack type.

initiative: >
  A [[stat]] measuring a combination of accuracy and evasiveness of a ship in combat. 
  A ship with higher initiative gets to deal dammage before a ship with low one. In the simulation, initiative
  direcly relates to the number of attacks a ship can make before a ship with 0 initiative.
power: >
  A [[stat]] measuring the surplus power a reactor can provide. This mostly refers to the surge power 
  that military ships can bring in combat to power modules like railguns, coilguns power-intensive ACS.
  Power can be increased with modules like [[shpmod_reactor]]

resource: >
  A resource reperesents a certain collection of goods needed to build a modules of ship. Resources are
  stored and produced on a planet-by-planet level. Resources can be transported between planets by any 
  [[ship]] in a [[transfer]].
  A special resource is [[water]], which is used as fuel every [[transfer]]
allegiance: TBD

shipyard: >
  A shipyard is a collection of modules that can be used to build modules and ships. There are 4 shipyard
  modules: [[shpmod_small_yard_1]], [[shpmod_small_yard_2]], [[shpmod_small_yard_3]], [[shpmod_small_yard_4]].
  Each collection of [[shpmod_small_yard_2]] & [[shpmod_small_yard_3]] can build modules.
  Each collection of [[shpmod_small_yard_3]] & [[shpmod_small_yard_4]] can reapair ships.
  Each collection of all 4 can build ships.
transfer: >
  A transfer of a single [[ship]] between [[planet]]. A transfer is defined by the departure and arrival times.
  By default the times are set to give the transfer with the least [[Δv]], thus able to carry the most payload.
  The arrival time can be rushed or the departure time delayed in cost for more [[Δv]].
  Depending on how much [[Δv]] the transfer costs, how much [[weight]] the ship carries and if the engine
  is hydrogen consuming, the ship will use a certain ammount of [[water]] as fuel. More exotic [[ship_class]]
  may use different materials a fuel. The fuel will be lost from the departuring [[planet]]. If the planet cannot 
  provide enough fuel, the trnasfer cannot take place.
