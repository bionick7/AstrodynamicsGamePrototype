    Previous manufacturing efforts relied on the previous experience and intuition of
    older experts, able to coordinate a small group of people. As we venture into more and
    more complex technology, this form of nonchalant, informal management will inevitably
    reach their limits. To deal with these challenges of scale and coordination, we must
    take a look at our former enemy's playbook.

    Before we can trust our continued existence on ever increasingly fragile and precarious 
    systems of technology, office environments, bureaucratic hierarchies and responsibility 
    traces need to be established and we need to dedicate the most experienced people on
    ensuring the safe and efficient development of new technologies.

  description: >
    As propellant, energy storage or ingredient in chemical processes, hydrogen is one of most 
    ubiquitous resources in our modern society. As inhabitants of Saturn and the universe, it
    is also by far the most ubiquitous resource in our environment. The problem lies in extracting
    and storing the material. Handling the material often needs cryogenic (very cold) temperatures
    achieved through cryogenic heatpumps. Hydrogen, alongside with oxygen is primarily produced from
    water through electrolysis, but can also be extracted directly from Saturn, if you can afford
    to bring it back up

- name: Ship Specialization
  id: tech_equipment
  description: >
    Most people are familiar with the concept of modularity in the context of larger stations.
    The station consists of a main bus providing living space power and a structural framework,
    where modules can added onto. The modules then provide the actual industrial or civil function
    of the station. Fewer people are aware that most ships are build with, to some extent, the same
    philosophy. The idea is that ships can be re-purposed at any time for crisis situations, demand
    spikes or even war.

  description: >
    Generally, most human activity on a planet takes place on the various stations in orbit.
    Some parts, however, like resource extraction require boots on the ground. The connection
    between these surface outposts and the stations up above is made by specially designed
    shuttles. Smaller shuttles only work on smaller bodies with low orbital velocities. Larger
    bodies like Titan require large shuttles. Most of these shuttles consume 'water' in the form
    in hydrogen and oxygen in their daily routines.

  description: >
    It is possible to give ships temporary tanks with additional fuel.
    The ships will drain these tanks first and then eject the empty tanks 
    to save on mass, which allow ships to reach a bit further or carry a bit
    more then they ordinarily would. Even though the concept of staged
    rocketry is ancient, redeveloping tanks that fit our ships and can hold
    cryogenic liquids well enough still requires some experience with
    cryogenic liquids.
