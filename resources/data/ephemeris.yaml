name: Saturn
description: >
  The 6th 'proper' planet around the Sun. Most people born here will never
  live outside it's gravitational and social sphere of influence. The monolithic
  ringed sphere is an ever-present background to all mundane and extraordinary
  activity that takes place on its Moons.

- name: Low Orbit
  description: >
    Not a planetary body, but more of an abstract location. Several stations are set up here,
    grazing the atmosphere to collect hydrogen and helium from Saturn. There used to be more,
    but the collapse of GK lead to abandonment of a lot of station de-orbiting in a matter
    of days.

    Low orbit is easy to get to with proper heat shielding, but much trickier to leave.

- name: Encke Gap
  description: >
    Another location. The Encke Gap started a popular launching destination for
    retrieving various resources (mostly water) from the A-ring. Over time, a
    sizable quasi-independent community accumulated around a certain cluster in 
    the Encke gap. This community mostly survived to this day and is willing to
    let us build our own stations here, as long as we pay them a small fee.

- name: Mimas
  description: >
    As host of one of the first science outposts, Mimas is home to the 
    'Politeknika Universitato Mimas' or PUM. PUM was the sole higher education
    and therefore responsible to train all medical, engineering, and administrative
    staff born on Saturn. As this monopoly within a monopoly, PUMs influence is
    enormous. As the only major institution left on Mimas after the abandonment
    of GK, PUM quickly took over the planet and established an improvised government
    out of its existing university administration. Research previously dedicated
    to scientific questions of Saturn and theoretical engineering research has
    been halted to ensure long-term supply of life support and medical equipment.

    There is still a lot of knowledge and skill on Mimas, which is essential to
    building more advanced technologies.

    Enceladus used to be home of a larger shipyard. The docks are still visible form orbit.
    5 Large holes in the ice, surrounded by some small surface buildings. The majority of the
    complex is subterranean: workshops, storage, offices, residential areas. All powered by
    Enceladus's large tidal heating.

- name: Tethys
  description: >
    As the sole destination of interplanetary shipping, Tethys quickly became the de-facto 
    centerpoint for Saturn-based logistics. Due to its central location and cheap access to,
    surrounding moons, Generala Kosmonautiko set up their local offices around Tethys and 
    made and central to all logistics and trade in the system. For this reason, even after
    their abandonment, the population remaining had enough resources and infrastructure to
    not only survive, but expand and break the isolation to other planets.

- name: Rhea
  description: >
    Rhea has always been the resource well of the System, as a significant part of the surface
    is composed of rocks instead of being purely ice. Large queries span the rock-rich environment
    of Rhea to extract large amounts of rock that can be used for either surface construction or 
    to gain metal ores. There are still some people around that can run these facilities and agreed
    to sell us a good amount of rock.

- name: Titan
  description: >
    By far the largest of Saturn's Moons and the arguably the most exotic place in
    the solar system. Titan has a lot of physical particularities: its thick nitrogen
    atmosphere, its active weather, but was initially surprisingly unimportant in the 
    development of the colony. When people started to strive for self-sufficiency in
    light of GKs imminent abandonment, the so-called Brotherhood, lead by a rich iranian
    family hoping to build their own empire on the frontier. Their current leader is
    an eccentric young man believing himself to be an ancient persian king and not much
    is known about their actual society. They are, however, generally hospitable to us
    and open to trade carbon.

  description: >
    The Martian Government (or KROMZZAKA SSUZOΠKUXA) needs no introduction. It is 
    known that their long-term goal is to control the outer planets and make them 
    profitable vassals for resource extraction. They have held onto Iapetus since
    the early days of the GK colony and turned it into a sizable outpost. It can
    service and refuel a small fleet and has a small military complement of its
    own. After the abandonment, they are still seeking diplomatic means to gain 
    power and influence, but who knows when they will resort to more direct means.

  description: >
    Most likely a captured asteroid, this small moonlet has its own odd orbit far
    away from the human activity in the rest of the System. There used to be a
    telescope complex here, used for both scientific and military intelligence 
    purposes. The place has been abandoned when official support for the rest of
    the colony waned.
