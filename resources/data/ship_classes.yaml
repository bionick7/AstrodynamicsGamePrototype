  name: C1K-998
  description: >
    Despite beeing nowadays classified as a light freightship, the C1K was
    at its time the largest cargo ship at the time of its construction. With
    simple Hydrolox combustion engines, this design was ideal to haul large
    ammount of cargo with cislunar space. After loosing popularity around the 
    2060s, some modified version made it to the outer planets and found some 
    popularity due to their large maintenancy ecosystem and their independance 
    of nuclear fuel.

  name: Station 10M
  description: >
    General Cosmonautics space station bus is a structural framework that can 
    hold 10 metric kilotonns of cargo. It is often used for medium sized habitats, 
    shipyards and logistics points. 
    The station has just enough propulsion to maintain orbit and attitude 
    and cannot be used to transport equipment between points
