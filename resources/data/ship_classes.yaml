  name: C3G-022 'Spermwhale'
  description: >
    A larger variant that carries triple the fuel and triple the engines pf the Hedgehog.
    Notably, it has the capacity to transport module usually reserved for large stations, 
    like shipyard docks.

  name: C1G-998 'Hedgehog'
  description: >
    Despite being nowadays classified as a light freightship, the C1K was
    the largest cargo ship at the time of its construction. With
    simple Hydrolox combustion engines, this design was ideal to haul large
    amount of cargo with cislunar space. After loosing popularity around the 
    2060s, some modified version made it to the outer planets and found some 
    popularity due to their large maintenance ecosystem and their independence 
    from nuclear fuel.

  description: >
    General Cosmonautics space station bus is a structural, thermal and power
    framework that can hold 10 metric kilotonns of cargo. It is often used for 
    medium sized habitats, shipyards and logistics points. 
    The station has just enough propulsion to maintain orbit and attitude 
    and cannot be used to transport equipment between points

  name: N1Q-034 'Hawk'
  description: >
    One of the earliest truly commercially successful nuclear thermal cargo spacecraft, 
    the Hawk played a large role in making some interplanetary colonies financially successful.
    The vessel is still useful today and its comparably low-complexity cheap nuclear engine makes its 
    construction approachable.
