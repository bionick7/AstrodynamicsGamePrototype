    Alright, so THADCON recently reached out to some survivors on Encelladus. 
    They are in need of a great many things, THADCON could somehow afford to bundle
    together an entire count worth of emergency supplies. So that's our first real
    jo. No formal time limit, but hurry up, there's not a lot else to do anyway.

    I understand that we needed to deliver the supply in a hurry, but surely you
    thought about how to get the ship back ? Encelladus is nowhere near maintaining its
    own port and refuling at its current state. Only us and titan really are.

    I have discussed the possibility with {{}} to buy some old water mining equipment
    and modifying it to install on a ship. This way we can extract water from any
    icey moon from the ship.

    I have been able to negotiate the price of the ship-ready mining equipment down to MÂ§M 2 M.
    Preliminary forecast predicts that deal to be very advantageous in the long term, but the decision
    is up to you.
