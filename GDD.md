# Game Design Document

## Experimentation:
immediatly buy/sell + disable water as fuel (for now)
get economy semi-enjoyable
add urgency with quests

## Ships
```
light freighter:
    1kT
    4km/s H20
bulk freighter:
    3kT
    4km/s H20
nuclear freighter:
    1kT
    10km/s H2
express:
    1kT
    20km/s H2
long-flight ships ... (modules?)
```
Ship modules for:
- engines
- heat shields
- flight duration extension

ship modules stats:
- mass
- building cost
- maintenance toll

## Buildings

## Decisions
### solar-system scale vs. planetary scale

Driving factors are population nd building expansion
Working over terms of years
\+ Proven concept \
\+ Can introduce a lot of different concepts for buildings and ships
\- Operates on a more detached, more distant level \
\- Only one setting (Solar system)

VS

Driving factors are immediate issues
Working over terms of days
Ships could still be upgradable, buildings less so
\+ More close, personal and concrete in vibe \
\+ Each planet it's own setting \
\- Unproven gameplay
\- Risk of becoming boring very quickly

=> Planetary scale

### population/tech driven vs. quest driven
\+ e.g. Stellaris \
\+ tangible power scaling \
\+ can introduce more tech ideas \
\+ more organic storytelling \
\- not realistic for small scales \
\- Would force very large timescales \

VS

\+ e.g. Endless sky \
\+ more personal \
\+ new tech has a background\
\- more manual work \
\- progress less foreseeable \

=> Give lots of quests that can give new tech, or rare resources

### economy/monetary vs. balancing needs
company RP \
\+ natural and organic filler between quests \
\- hard to make it always worth doing something \
\- needs simulated market \
\- who cares about money as an end goal? \

VS

gov. RP \
\+ naturally high stakes \
\- possibly long situations with nothing to do \

=> Allow for trading non-essential items, but end-goal is to sustain colonies

## Design parameters
Scarcity of quests
lots of quests => pick quests to optimize trajectory
few quests => get inventive with quests
lots of quests w. few exceptional ones

Price of fuel
cheap => encourage frequent use of ships
expensive => plan trips carefully. Plays into scarcity

## Gameplay ideas
Player plays a company/org spanning various colonies.
Other colonies exist.
Goal is to expand by acquiring new colonies and sustain the existing ones.


=> How do we make these 'quests/missions' interesting?
- reach hard-to-reach places
- interesting narrative
- incorporate combat
- yield various components


## Gamplay loops
Loop A << current  focus

Target period: ???
- receive quest
- evaluate quest
- plan transfers
- consider placement of additional ships

Progression vague rn. 
How does loop A play into B in a way that the player can plan? (look: urbek, dredge)
Loop B (main)
- implement tech  << more player agency here
- 

//
- take quests

//
- build up fleet
